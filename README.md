# Fractal
This program includes generating "Maple leaf", "Fern", "Fractal tree", "Sierpinski triangle".
There are many ways to generate fractal shape.

In this simple program I used statistical method to generate the fractal shape.
The shapes can be zoomed in/out and be placed at any position as mouse dragging event.
